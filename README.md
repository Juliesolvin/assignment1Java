README for RPG game - Assignment 1 in Java, Experis Academy

This project consists of 4 packages: Attributes, Exceptions, game and Heros. 

In the Attributes package, there is an Attribute-class. This is the file that holds all of the attributes
for armors and characters. 

In exceptions, we have the exceptions for "invlaid level" and "invalid weapon", ect. 
In game, I have gathered items, as classes as weapon, Armors ect., and Enums as Slot, Armors and Weapons. 
In Heros, we have both the test-classes, that is still being worked on, and all of the character-classes. 

You can make a character as a Mage, Rogue, Ranger or Warrior. 
All of these characters have attributes (Vitality, Intelligence, strength, dexterity). 
Armors also has these attributes, so the characters "Primary" attributes are their own base attributes PLUS the armos-attributes. 
Every character has damage it can deal, and they also have different places on the body they can equip the weapon or armor (called slots).

This is the shell of a RPG game.
